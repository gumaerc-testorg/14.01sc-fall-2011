We have already learned about the operation of two very different types of markets: perfectly competitive markets and monopolists. However, most markets don’t fall into either category. For example, think of the market for soda - both Pepsi and Coke are major producers, and they dominate the market. This type of market structure is known as an oligopoly, and it is the subject of this lecture.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} What is the definition of a dominant strategy? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A strategy that is never optimal.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A strategy that is optimal if the other player plays an identical strategy.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A strategy that is optimal if the other player plays the opposite strategy.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}A strategy that is optimal independent of the other player's decision.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}A strategy that is not optimal in some cases, or that is never optimal, cannot be a dominant strategy.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} What is the definition of a reaction curve? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A curve that relates marginal cost and marginal revenue for a monopolist.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A curve that relates marginal cost and price for a perfectly competitive firm.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A curve that relates price and profits for a perfectly competitive firm.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}A curve that relates the optimal quantity produced by one firm in an oligopoly to the optimal quantity produced by the second firm.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is that a reaction curve relates the optimal quantity produced by one firm in an oligopoly to the optimal quantity produced by the second firm. It shows the relationship between the optimal quantity produced by each of two firms operating in a Cournot equilibrium. The other three answers correspond to concepts that are relevant for a monopolist or a competitive market, but not in an oligopoly.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} The diagram below shows the reaction curves for firm A and firm B competing in a Cournot market. Which point denotes the equilibrium?

##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} In the game of the Prisoners' Dilemma, the dominant cooperative equilibrium strategy is what? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Both players keep silent.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Both players talk to the police.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Player 1 keeps silent, and player 2 talks to the police.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Player 2 keeps silent, and player 1 talks to the police.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The dominant cooperative equilibrium strategy in the Prisoners' Dilemma is that both players keep silent. However, given that we generally assume that players cannot cooperate, the dominant non-cooperative equilibrium is that both players speak to the police.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
