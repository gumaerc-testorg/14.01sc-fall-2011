How many of you have received flowers for Valentine's Day? Of course, February in New England is snowy, and those flowers are not raised locally—they are imported from other countries. International trade is hugely important in national and international economies today, but up to this point it has been excluded from our models. In this lecture, a basic introduction to the principles of international trade is provided.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} Assume two countries, Country 1 and Country 2, are producing only two goods, apples and oranges. The opportunity cost of producing an apple is higher in Country 1. Which country has a comparative advantage in producing apples? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Both countries.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Country 1.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Country 2.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Neither country.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Country 2 has a comparative advantage in producing apples, because the opportunity cost of producing apples is lower in Country 2 (higher in Country 1).{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} Now assume that in Country 1, producing one extra orange requires sacrificing the production of two apples. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of oranges for apples is -2. {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Marginal rate of substitution.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Marginal rate of transformation.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}None of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Price ratio.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is the marginal rate of transformation. The marginal rate of transformation captures the rate at which one output good could be transformed into another output good if resources were re-assigned.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} When an import tariff is imposed on a good that is imported by a given country, which of the following quantities decreases? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Consumer surplus and social welfare.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Consumer surplus.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Producer surplus.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Social welfare.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Both consumer surplus and social welfare will decline when a tariff is imposed. Consumer surplus declines because consumers pay higher prices for products they purchase. Producer surplus will increase, but not sufficiently to outweigh the decline in consumer surplus, and overall social welfare will decline due to deadweight loss.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} Which of the following can be a source of comparative advantage in international trade? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}All of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Endowments of labor.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Endowments of natural resources.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Technological differences.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Differences in endowments of natural resources, labor or technological differences can all be the source of a comparative advantage for a country in producing a given good.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
