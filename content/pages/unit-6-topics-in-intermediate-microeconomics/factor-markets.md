Earlier in the semester, we discussed the labor supply decisions made by consumers when deciding how much they should or should not work. However, firms have the power to decide how many workers to hire. This lecture focuses on the operation of firms in the factor markets that supply the factors (labor and capital) they use in production.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} In a perfectly competitive labor market, firms should hire workers until the wage is equal to what quantity? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The marginal product of labor.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The marginal revenue.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The price multiplied by the marginal product of labor.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The price.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is the wage should be equal to P\*MP{{< sub "L" >}}, or the price multiplied by the marginal product of labor. The wage captures the cost of hiring one additional worker, and this should be equal to the benefit of hiring that worker. This is equal to the amount the additional worker will produce (MP{{< sub "L" >}}) multiplied by the price.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} If the factor supply market is competitive, each firm will face a supply curve for labor that has what characteristic? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Downward-sloping.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Horizontal.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Upward-sloping.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Vertical.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}If the factor supply market is competitive, each firm will face a labor supply curve that is horizontal (i.e., perfectly elastic), and the firm can hire as many workers as it wants to at the market wage. The labor supply curve for the entire market, on the other hand, will generally not be horizontal.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} How does the elasticity of the long-run demand for labor compare to the elasticity of the short-run demand for labor? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Depends on the shape of the demand curve.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Equally elastic.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Less elastic.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}More elastic.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is that the demand for labor is more elastic in the long-run than in the short-run. In the short-run, capital is fixed, and thus a firm's ability to adjust its labor supply is typically limited. In the long-run, capital is also flexible, and this extra option makes firm's labor demand more elastic.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} If a given labor market is characterized by monopsony (i.e., a company town in which there is only one employer), how does the level of hiring compare to that in a competitive factor market? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It depends on the price of the output good.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The level of hiring is equal.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The level of hiring is higher.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The level of hiring is lower.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is that a monopsony will hire fewer workers (the level of hiring is lower) than a competitive market, and it will hire those workers at a lower wage. The reason for this is that when a monopsony seeks to hire more workers, the overall market wage increases, and the firm then has to pay this higher market wage to all its employees. This poisoning effect in the factor market leads the firm to hire fewer workers.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
